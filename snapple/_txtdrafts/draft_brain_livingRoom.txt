>> SURVEY
This room appears to be some sort of bridge. A odd command chair lies opposite a display screen. Near the command chair is a light-emitter and a flat surface.

>> EXAMINE GLOWTOWER
A tall vertical spindle, flared at the base and at the top. Light spills out the top of the spindle and fills the room.

>> EXAMINE COMMAND CHAIR
A very strange command chair. It must be for a very wide sort of creature, as the chair is nearly four times as wide as any sort of standard model.

>> if(televisionOn == false) EXAMINE RECTANGLE
Another of the strange non-holographic devices that seem prevalent on this planet. If there is a means of interfacing with this, it is one which is beyond the understanding of your mindcrystal.

>> if(televisionOn == true) EXAMINE GLOWRECTANGLE
The command screen is active, showing a series of images of life-things with their appendages wrapped around each other. There are a series of vibrations in the air, as well.

Do these life-things communicate using vibrations? They are perhaps not so alien after all. It might be possible to replicate these particular vibrations using rudimentary crystallic harmonic vibrationization. 

>> if(televisionOn == true) EXAMINE BUTTONPLANK
A slender plank, studded with a number of beautiful grey gems. It is glistening and damp.
