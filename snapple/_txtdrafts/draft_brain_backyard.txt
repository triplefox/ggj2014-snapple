FIRST PUZZLE - BRAIN
LOCATION: BACKYARD

>> SURVEY

The obelisks enclose three sides of a wide rectangular area filled with masses of life-things. The fourth side is mostly occupied by a tall, flat surface adorned with squares of a reflective material.

Ahead is a tremendous life-thing, menacingly towering above the others by orders of magnitude. Is this stoic monstrosity the ruler of these silent revelers?

>> EXAMINE KING OF THE LIFE-THINGS

Dour and terrible, this silent tyrant glowers from on high at the countless life-things that shiver in fear or reverence below it. Foul, inky shadows gather in pools at its feet in tribute to what is doubtlessly a hideous might.

It does not react. Best to leave it.

>> EXAMINE FLAT SURFACE

The wall is largely unadorned, except for a flat rectangular gem, reflective and almost completely transparent.

>> EXAMINE MACHINE

Itâ€™s a car, obviously.
